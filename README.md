# hungry-OAuthSample
A partial implementation of the OAuth2.0 spec in kotlin with ktor.io

## Description
We've all seen OAuth solutions before, whether it be an SSO integration or a B2B solution.
So I wanted to try implementing the specification myself (yes OAuth is a spec not an implementation).
Mainly as a challenge and learning tool for myself, but a longer term objective would be to use it as a learning tool for others.

This project uses Kotlin and [Ktor.io](https://ktor.io), I'm new to both so feel free to point out more "kotliny" ways of doing things.

Disclaimer: This is not production ready, feel free to fork but would not recommend running in production as is.

## Running
For now, the best way run is via the intellij IDE as mentioned [here](https://ktor.io/docs/running.html#intellij-idea)

## Testing
Unit tests are a TODO at the moment, but when running locally you can use the postman collection `postman.json` to test.
